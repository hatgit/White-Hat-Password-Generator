# Chrome Web Store Listing (v0.3.403 Update)

**Summary**:
Generate cryptographically secure passwords instantly with a modern, dark-mode UI. 100% offline & open-source.

**Description**:

Elevate your cybersecurity with the **all-new White Hat Password Generator**. 

We have completely redesigned the experience with a sleek **Glassmorphism Dark Mode UI**, live interactive sliders, and instant feedback—making it easier than ever to secure your digital life.

🛡️ **Why White Hat Password Generator?**
In the digital age, unique and strong passwords are your first line of defense. This extension allows you to generate cryptographically-secure passwords (CSPRNG) instantly, ensuring that your accounts remain safe from brute-force attacks and leaks.

✨ **New in Version 0.3.403:**
*   **Modern Dark Mode**: A beautiful, eye-friendly "Glassmorphism" design.
*   **Live Generation**: Passwords update instantly as you adjust the slider or toggle settings.
*   **Dynamic Security Meter**: Visualize your password strength in real-time with our signature color scale (Purple = Alien Proof!).
*   **Smart Toggles**: Replaced old checkboxes with modern iOS-style switches for smoother control.

🔐 **Uncompromised Security & Privacy:**
*   **100% Local & Offline**: All code runs locally on your device. No data is ever sent to the cloud, 3rd party servers, or analytics.
*   **Cryptographically Secure**: We use the W3C `crypto.getRandomValues()` API, the gold standard for web cryptography, ensuring valid entropy that is mathematically unfeasible to predict.
*   **Open Source**: Our code is fully transparent and available on GitHub. We presume nothing and verify everything.
*   **Zero Bloat**: No tracking, no ads, no unnecessary permissions.

🚀 **Key Features:**
*   **One-Click Insertion**: Right-click on any field to instantly "Generate Secure Password".
*   **Total Control**: customize length (up to 128 chars) and character sets (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, Symbols, Binary).
*   **Entropy Calculation**: We don't just guess; we mathematically calculate the bits of entropy so you know exactly how strong your password is (e.g., 128-bit, 256-bit+).
*   **Quantum Ready**: Generate passwords with 512+ bits of entropy for future-proof security.

**A Message from the Developer:**
"I created this tool because most password generators were either ugly, insecure, or closed-source. I wanted a tool that I could trust for my own cybersecurity—one that teaches you about entropy while keeping you safe. With this new update, we've matched that backend security with a premium frontend experience." — Steven Hatzakis
