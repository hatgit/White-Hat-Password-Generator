# White Hat Password Generator: The Ultimate Chrome Plugin Solution for Cryptographically-Secure Password Generation.
Elevate your password security, before it's too late!

 **[Click Here to install from Google Chrome Store:](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/white-hat-password-genera/pbofgfidfngmafemlgkjmllolchjnmgk/)**

- Easily Insert new passwords with one-click, on any password field (requires simply right-clicking and selecting Generate Secure Password from drop-down menu).

- Take control of the cybersecurity for your personal and business needs with White Hat Password Generator!

The one-click passwords are pre-set to 18 characters and produce roughly 111-bits of security, making them suitable for most use-cases which may restrict the length beyond 18 characters.

For those demanding even stronger (and longer) passwords (or shorter passwords that will be weaker), use the Chrome plugin interface for more advanced settings, including specifying your desired password length, character sets, and compute the resulting security level (i.e. 128-bit, 256-bit, 512-bit), and instantly see how strong or weak your password is to take control of your cybersecurity.

In this digital age, it's more important than ever to use strong and unique passwords for each account to protect your sensitive data. With White Hat Password Generator, you can create cryptographically-secure passwords of various levels of strength in seconds, for both online and offline use.

## Why Trust this app?

All the code in this plugin runs locally from your device, and all code dependencies are in-line, with no reliance on 3rd party websites. In otherwords, the passwords you create with this app remain locally on your device and aren't sent to any 3rd party websites or servers, etc.. In addition, there is no data that is being shared with anyone or collected by the developer, other than basic usage statistics provided on the Chrome webstore to developers, such as the number of installations. We believe the app to be ultra safe and trust the code which is open source and available on Github: https://github.com/hatgit/White-Hat-Password-Generator

I created this app because I found myself constantly running custom python code whenever I wanted to create a strong password when logging into a new service or resetting my password for one of my online accounts.

Yet, I wanted to make it easy for myself, and millions of people to not only create secure passwords, but learn about password security during the process, to make the internet a safer place.

I call this method the White Hat Password System, and the White Hat Password Generator is an important tool as part of this system of approaching password security.

## What makes this software safe?
This Chrome plugin uses the 'getRandomValues' command which is a trusted cryptographic primitive from the W3C Crypto API (https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/), which securely sources entropy as part of its Cryptographically-Secure Pseudo Random Number Generator (CSPRNG).

**Disclosure**: The author of this software is a contributor to the above mentioned W3C Crypto API code base on Github (user: @hatgit).

The use of this CSPRNG makes it unfeasible for a password generated with this software to be predicted or brute-force guessed, provided that you specify a sufficient length and character sets, so that the resulting security is strong (64-127 bits), very strong (over 128 bits), or stronger (+256 bits), where the stronger the security the less feasible it is for an attacker to guess your password.

That said, users must still ensure their devices are secure and that no one is eavesdropping when they are performing related actions involving their cybersecurity (be sure to run anti-virus and anti-malware and have strong network passwords and cybersecurity measures and only install trusted applications).

## **Features of this plugin:**

- **Insert Passwords with a Click:** You can generate a secure password and insert it into any password field with a simple right-click.

- **Advanced Settings:** Choose your desired level of security, length, and character sets for complete control over the password generation process. The app will also show you how secure your password is with color-coded legends.

- **Multiple Character Sets:** Use uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to make your passwords even more complex and secure. White Hat Password Generator will calculate the entropy to show you the resulting security level.

- **Easy to Use:** With a simple interface, even non-technical users will find the app easy to navigate.

- **Save Time:** Generate strong passwords in seconds without spending time creating them on your own.

- **Increase Security:** By using strong and unique passwords for each account, you'll greatly increase the security of your online accounts and sensitive data.

- **No More Password Reuse:** Create unique passwords for each account to avoid being vulnerable to cyberattacks.

- **Flexible Password Generation:** Create numerical passwords, such as pins, of various lengths for increased security, or more character sets for increased entropy (the higher the entropy, the higher the resulting security level of your passwords, as measured in bits)

With a default password length of 18 characters and a combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and common special characters, resulting passwords have about 111 bits of security. However, you can customize your password to meet your security needs, such as 256-bits which is suitable for cryptography and cryptocurrency applications, or up to 511-bit security for quantum resistance, and even higher (but inevitably longer passwords).

White Hat Password Generator is the ultimate solution for creating cryptographically-secure passwords of various levels of strength quickly and easily.

Take control of your personal cybersecurity with the assurance that your passwords are safe and secure, while learning more about password security.

- **About secure passwords:** Just because a password is generated in a cryptographically-secure manner, doesn't mean it will be strong enough to be secure, if it doesn't carry sufficient entropy which is a measure of its strength using bits of security. This means a password with sufficient entropy is either long or sourced from a wide ranger of distinct characters, or has a combination of both.

Unlike most password generators, White Hat Password Generator not only calculates the precise security strength of passwords it generates but also displays it to you, so that you can understand the level of security for the passwords you create with this software. Most software strength meters do not correctly calculate the actual strength the way we do.
